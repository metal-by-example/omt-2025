# Fundamentals of 3D Graphics Programming with Metal 

This repository contains the sample code for the "Fundamentals of 3D Graphics Programming with Metal" workshop at One More Thing Conference 2025.

## Structure

This repo contains three projects:

 - `MetalDeviceCheck` is a small SwiftUI app that displays a few details about the Metal device it is running on.
 - `MetalFundamentals-Initial` contains the samples in their unmodified state
 - `MetalFundamentals-Final` contains the samples as they are modified throughout the workshop to implement various techniques

## Cloning

I recommend cloning this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:metal-by-example/omt-2025.git
```

so that you can easily diff your changes with the clean state of the repo.
